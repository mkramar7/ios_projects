Backup of numerous iOS projects that I've worked on while learning from these materials:

- [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
- [Stanford iOS Course (CS193p)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)
- [AppCoda's Beginning iOS Programming book](https://www.appcoda.com/swift/)
